## Where were fonts obtained from?

Open Sans fonts are obtained from:

## Generated `woff2` compressed versions

Since the fonts above are provided either as `ttf` or `otf` which are uncompressed versions of the fonts, we needed to generate the compressed `woff2` versions. The follwing utility was used for that purpose and the output fonts are included in this directory.
https://github.com/google/woff2
